# Augment-for-Shot-Put-IT
# Description
The aim of this report is to study the limitations of the actual technologies used to record the shot put athletes performance, in order to improve their training and make it more efficient and professional. Therefore, we have developed a Matlab application that uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) as a method of recording the values of acceleration and gyroscope. To identify the acceleration and gyroscope values, we recorded the videos and data from a professional shot put athlete. 
# Instructions
# Further work
Further data collection to other professional athletes is required to determine exactly how acceleration and gyroscope values affect the results of the calculated parameters (impulse, peak force, peak velocity, peak rotation speed). 

It was not possible to implement the Kalman filter although the data recorded is partially cleaned by applying an Exponentially-Weighted Moving Average (EWMA). Therefore, further work on how other filters clean the data should be done.

Another major improvement that could be made is developing the code so that this application that is now only useful for shot put athletes is also effective for other sports like sledge hammer, discus and javelin throw. In addition, other upgrades that can be made are to allow the user to choose the speed of the video displayed in the fourth window and also developing a code that synchronizes the video and the data automatically.
